# MIS-Bank-Marketing-Data-Analysis-Project
Relational database and analysis for banking marketing dataset using PostgreSQL.

## Overview
This project analyzes customer subscription patterns in a banking marketing dataset using PostgreSQL. The goal is to derive actionable insights to optimize campaign strategies.
### Current Situation
Banks rely heavily on marketing campaigns to promote their financial products. However, intense competition in the market, driven by factors such as fluctuating interest rates on mortgage and certificate of deposit (CD) products and the increasing reliance on digital platforms, has made it challenging for banks to attract customers. Additionally, many banks are no longer hiring traditional bankers due to emerging technological innovations that allow customers to independently compare financial products and apply for them online. Therefore, an effective marketing strategy has become crucial for banks to remain competitive in the market

Despite significant investments in marketing, banks often struggle with low conversion rates, as many campaigns fail to successfully convert leads into customers. Furthermore, insufficient targeting leads to higher costs and reduced return on investment (ROI), ultimately impacting the overall performance of marketing campaigns and business profitability.

### Business Problem
In this competitive landscape, banks need effective strategies to attract and retain customers who are more likely to subscribe to term deposit products. 

Achieving this requires identifying key factors influencing customer decisions and optimizing marketing efforts to focus on high-potential leads, thereby enhancing conversion rates and reducing costs.


### Goal
The goal is to develop a database system that supports predictive analytics, enabling banks to derive actionable insights for improved customer targeting. By analyzing data, the system aims to predict with greater accuracy whether a client is likely to subscribe to a term deposit through direct marketing campaigns.
